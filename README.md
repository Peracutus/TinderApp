# TinderApp

<h3>Following by Bryan Voong from youtube chanel "Let's build that app"</h3></p>


:white_check_mark:  In this case, i would like to introduce stacks like:
* Firestore,
* image pass data between app and firestore, 
* functional reactive programming, 
* validation for text fields,
*  **MVVM pattern**, 
*  Clear code, 
*  UIKit,  
*  SOLID
